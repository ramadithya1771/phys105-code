# PHYS 105A: Introduction to Scientific Computing

* Spring 2024
* Wednesday 11:00am-12:50pm
* PAS 272 computer lab

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Course Description

This lecture will provide an overview of what scientific 
computing is and its importance in various fields, 
such as physics and astronomy. The students will learn 
about the different applications of scientific computing,
such as simulating physical phenomena, analyzing experimental 
data, and solving complex mathematical problems.
The students will learn about the role of computers in 
scientific computing, including their capabilities and 
limitations. They will learn about the 
different programming languages that are commonly used 
in scientific computing, such as Python, C/C++, 
and their advantages and disadvantages. 
By the end of the course, the students will 
have a clearer sense of the role of programming in 
scientific computing and how it is used to solve 
scientific as well as daily problems.

During the first lecture, 
the students will be introduced to the overall structure 
of the course and the topics that will be covered in 
each lecture. They will learn about the goals and objectives 
of the course, the prerequisites, and the assessment 
methods. They will also be given a brief overview of 
the project that they will be working on at the end of the course.
By the end of the course, students should be able to solve simple physics
problems numerically, create plots to visualize their results, and
document their work and communicate with other physicists.
This course is prerequisite to PHYS 305 Computational Physics.

* aware of a wide range of science use cases, and develop the skill to
  self-learn computation tools and methods.

### Course Format and Teaching Methods

Class meets on Wednesday from 11:00am-12:50pm.
It includes about 50 min of lecture and 50 min of
hands-on exercises. There will be assignments and projects.
Students are required to complete them on time.

### Class attendance 

"Attendance" includes attending class regularly, 
completing in-class assignments, completing projects and presentations.
Students are also encouraged to participate discussions during class, 
seeking help during study sessions and office hours, etc.

Masks are recommended, but not required, 
in most indoor spaces including classrooms.  
Further detail may be found at 
https://covid19.arizona.edu/face-coverings.  
 
Please note that you may go to [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Feffective-masks.html) and search by state and county to get the recommendation based on the community levels of infection. 

Notify your instructors if you will be missing a class.
[Campus Health](https://health.arizona.edu/) provides testing for COVID-19.
Visit the [UArizona COVID-19](https://covid19.arizona.edu/) page for
regular updates.

### Course Communications

Email is the official method to communicate with the instructor.

### Equipments and Tools

As a course on scientific computing, students are expected to have
access to a computer.
Students will be asked to install popular development tools such as
`Git` and Jupyter to their computers.

### Required/Suggested Readings

The instructor will provide students additional online videos to
broaden the students' knowledge on computational physics.
When bundled with assignments, students are required to watch them.
When provided as references, these videos are optional.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Assignments and Examinations: Schedule/Due Dates

There will be 9 assignments and 2 projects in total.
There will be no quiz or exam.

The homework will be assigned approximately once a week.
Students are expected to start working on their assignments during the
hands-on sessions, and finish them by midnight before the day of the
next sessions.

Students are expected to work on the projects in groups of two or
three people.
Students will have three weeks to finish their projects (see below).

### Writing Requirement

Although this is not a writing intensive course, good documentation is
essential in communicating science and developing software.
Students are required to provide enough written explanations in their
assignments.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Grading Scale and Policies

Each assignment worths 10 points and each project worths 20 points.
The points for a student's worst two assignments or one
project will not be counted.
In Class Attendance is 10 points.

This course provides regular letter grades (A-E), which are based on a
simple point system:

* A: 90-100 points
* B: 80-89 points
* C: 70-79 points
* D: 60-69 points
* E:  <60 points

No scaling will be applied.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) grades must be made in accordance
with University policies, which are available at
http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete
and
http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal,
respectively.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on an assignment or
project, the student must send the instructor a formal request through
email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time that the
student receives the grade.
Because no scale will be applied in the final grade, the final grade
cannot be re-evaluated.
The student is expected to know of their own performance throughout
the course.

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility.
We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us
feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves
to succeed.
To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous
activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone
calls, web surfing, etc.).

### Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of
physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
oneself.
See

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials.
However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent
effort unless otherwise instructed.
Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity
as described in the UA General Catalog.
See:
http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity.

### Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination.
In support of this commitment, the University prohibits
discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a
protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation,
gender identity, or genetic information. For more information,
including how to report a concern, please see
http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy.

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express
well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions.
We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such
opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or
discrimination of others.
